# FIORIIDOC
Fiori app to display IDOC status
This are the codes to create a FIORI app to display IDOC status. 
I am aware that this app is far from perfection, but I am happy that I can create such app considering I am still new to ABAP for FIORI which I used to build the app.

In this folder contained files for CDS views,(ZTJ_I*), CDS consumptions (ZTJ_C*), and CDS metada extension (ZTJ_E*)
Feel free to contact me at tjarliman@gmail.com for sharing about this app.
